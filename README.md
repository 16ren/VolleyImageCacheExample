Volley Image Cache
=====

An Android application that demonstrates how to implement a memory based and disk based L1 image cache with the the Volley library. The default implementation uses an in-memory cache (as recommended in the Volley comments) but there is a disk based implementation as well. You can change the implementation by altering the MainApplicatin file and passing in the desired Enum value for the cache type. This code demo has a companion blog post, [Google I/O 2013: Volley Image Cache Tutorial](http://blogs.captechconsulting.com/blog/raymond-robinson/google-io-2013-volley-image-cache-tutorial), which goes over the components and architecture used in this demo.
